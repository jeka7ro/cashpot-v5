# 🔧 Fix Render Configuration

## ❌ Problem:
Render is still trying to use `/opt/render/project/src/backend` as root directory.

## ✅ Solution:
You need to manually configure Render settings in the dashboard.

## 📋 Manual Steps in Render Dashboard:

### 1. Go to Render Dashboard
- Go to: https://render.com/dashboard
- Find your `cashpot-backend` service
- Click on it

### 2. Go to Settings
- Click on "Settings" tab
- Scroll down to "Build & Deploy"

### 3. Update Configuration
Change these settings:

**Root Directory:** 
- Leave EMPTY (don't put "backend")

**Build Command:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start Command:**
```
cd backend && python server.py
```

### 4. Save and Redeploy
- Click "Save Changes"
- Click "Manual Deploy" or "Redeploy"

## 🎯 Expected Result:
- Build should find `requirements.txt` in root
- Start command should run server from `backend/` directory
- Deployment should succeed

## 📁 File Structure:
```
/
├── requirements.txt          ← Render finds this
├── backend/
│   ├── server.py            ← Render runs this
│   └── render.yaml
└── frontend/
```

---
**After making these changes, redeploy and it should work! 🚀**
